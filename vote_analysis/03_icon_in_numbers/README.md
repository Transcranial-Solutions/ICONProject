# ICON in Numbers

This is a repository for codes used for weekly report on ICON Ecosystem.

'99_weekely_vote_change_all_in_one.py' is a one-click graph generator which does the followings:

1. Extracts data from www.iconvotemonitor.com and ICON Foundation website
2. Aggregate data into timeframe of interest (e.g. week, month)
3. Preprocessing of the data (manipulation, re-coding, calculation)
4. Plotting - requires a bit of tinkering due to y-axis changes each week

This also requires two data points for comparison - e.g) 2020-20 vs 2020-21 (weekly comparison)

'1_icon_community_webscraping.py' is not included in the one-click graph generator, so this will need to be done separately, 
but this is available for anyone to see at icon.community website

Please feel free to ask questions if you have any.
