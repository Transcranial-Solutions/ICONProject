# ICON in Numbers

This is a repository for codes used for weekly report on ICON Ecosystem.

'99_weekely_vote_change_all_in_one.py' is a one-click graph generator which does the followings:

1. Extracts data from www.iconvotemonitor.com and ICON Foundation website
2. Aggregate data into timeframe of interest (e.g. week, month)
3. Preprocessing of the data (manipulation, re-coding, calculation)
4. Plotting - requires a bit of tinkering due to y-axis changes each week

This also requires two data points for comparison - e.g) 2020-20 vs 2020-21 (weekly comparison)

Please feel free to ask questions if you have any.
